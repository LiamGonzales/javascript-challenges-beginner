/*
 Challenge 1: Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
    
    Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
    Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. 
    While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could 
    output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little 
    extra effort.
 */

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line

// function countNummbers(start, end) {
//    console.log(start);
//    if (start < end){
//       countNummbers(start + .75, end);
//    }
// }
// countNummbers(2, 1000)
// end = 100


for (let number = 0; number < array.length; number++) {
   const element = array[number];
   if (number < 10000, number + 2) {
      
   }
}
